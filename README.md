# Individual Data Science Project 
# Automated Stomatal Aperture Output Analysis

#Overview
This repository contains annotated Python code for the analysis of automated stomatal aperture measurements generated using a YOLO-based detection pipeline. The analysis examines abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes differing in vegetative phase identity.

## Contents
- `SwBio_Data_Assignment.ipynb` – this is the main analysis notebook
- `LD1_Automated_Width.csv` 
- `LD2_Automated_Width.csv`
- `LD3_Automated_Width.csv`  
  These datasets were generated by an automated stomatal phenotyping pipeline
- `SwBio_Individual_Report.pdf` – this is the short written report describing the analysis

## Requirements
The analysis was run using:
- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

No additional libraries are required.

## How to run
1. Download or copy this repository.
2. Ensure all CSV files are located in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open `SwBio_Data_Assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter.
4. Run all cells in order

## Output
The notebook produces:
- A quality-control summary table reporting raw and retained stomatal detections after filtering
- A boxplot visualising plant-level mean stomatal aperture width across ABA concentrations and genotypes.
